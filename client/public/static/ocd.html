        <h1>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health disorder characterized by recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These behaviors are often performed with the hope of preventing the obsessive thoughts or making them go away. However, this provides only temporary relief, and not performing the compulsive rituals can cause great anxiety.</p>
