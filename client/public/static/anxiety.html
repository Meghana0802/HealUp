        <h1>Anxiety</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Anxiety is a normal and often healthy emotion. However, when a       person regularly feels disproportionate levels
            of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder. Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses
            that lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry. These disorders alter how a person
            processes emotions and behaves, also causing physical symptoms. Mild anxiety might be vague and unsettling,
            while severe anxiety may seriously affect day-to-day living.</p>

        <h2>Tips to Overcome Anxiety:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Exercise Regularly:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical activity can help reduce stress and anxiety. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise
                        most days of the week. Activities like walking, jogging, yoga, and swimming can be particularly
                        effective.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Practice Mindfulness and Meditation:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Techniques such as meditation, mindfulness, and deep-breathing exercises can help calm your mind
                        and reduce anxiety. Apps like Headspace and Calm offer guided meditation sessions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Maintain a Healthy Diet:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating a balanced diet can have a positive impact on your mood and energy levels. Avoid caffeine
                        and alcohol, as they can increase anxiety levels.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Get Enough Sleep:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Establish a regular sleep routine and create a relaxing
                        bedtime environment to improve sleep quality.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Limit Screen Time:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce exposure to screens and digital devices, especially before bedtime. Excessive screen time
                        can increase stress and disrupt sleep patterns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Seek Professional Help:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your anxiety is overwhelming or persistent, consider seeking help from a mental health
                        professional. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be very effective in
                        managing anxiety disorders. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage symptoms.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Practice Relaxation Techniques:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and aromatherapy can help reduce
                        stress and anxiety levels.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Stay Organized:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping a to-do list and managing your time effectively can help you stay organized and reduce
                        anxiety related to daily tasks and responsibilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learn to Accept Uncertainty:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anxiety often stems from a fear of the unknown. Learning to accept that you can't control
                        everything and that uncertainty is a part of life can help reduce anxiety levels.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
