        <h1>Bipolar Disorder</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These shifts in mood and energy levels are more severe than the normal ups and downs that everyone goes through from time to time.</p>
